# Step 2: Test Soil Moisture Sensor
2. Download the Soil_Moisture_Test.ino sketch.
3. Open the Arduino IDE and choose the correct board and port.
4. Compile and upload the sketch.
5. Open the serial monitor.
6. Place the soil moisture sensor in soil or cup of water and observe the sensor readings.
7. Adjust the potentiometer on the soil moisture meter.
8. Change the analog values on Line 28 in the sketch to more accurately represent 0-100%. Write down the newly mapped values.
9. Compile, upload, and test again.
